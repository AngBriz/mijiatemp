If you would like to translate to the app for your language you must download on of the available xml-s (eg. the default english one) and translate it. 
The right way if you create a directory (value-<lang>) for the translated language eg. values-hu for Hungarian, values-de for German, etc.
The correct language codes are in ISO639-1 column from http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php
  
At the end you can init a merge in github or it's enough if you send the xml file to me to smrtprjcts+mijiabt at gmail dot com.

Thanks
